AB Testing Examples

A/B Testing is a common technique to compare two or more different groups who have a different version or change in order to determine which version or change performs better. This is also called experimentation which is helpful when testing new products, web pages, marketing tactics, user functionalities and more. 

In this notebook, I want to evaluate conversion results from an E-Commerce experimentation comparing an old page and a new page. Overall goal is to understand if there the organization should keep the old page or if there's signficant evidence to implement the new page. 

I'll showcase design experiment using a two tailed test. 

The data set used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohameddawoud/ecommerce-ab-testing).
