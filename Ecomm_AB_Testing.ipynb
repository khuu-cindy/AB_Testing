    "\n",
    "A/B Testing is a common technique to compare two or more different groups who have a different version or change in order to determine which version or change performs better. This is also called experimentation which is helpful when testing new products, web pages, marketing tactics, user functionalities and more. In this notebook, I want to evaluate conversion results from an E-Commerce experimentation comparing an old page and a new page. Overall goal is to understand if there the organization should keep the old page or if there's signficant evidence to implement the new page. This data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohameddawoud/ecommerce-ab-testing). "

    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- Random sampling: sample must be taken randomly\n",
    "- Independence: each observation must be independent\n",
    "- Normally distributed: sample data must be normally distributed around the sample mean, which naturally occurs in large samples due to central limit theorm\n",
    "- Constant Variance: variance between sample and population must be constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulate Hypothesis\n",
    "I want to prove if there's an impact in converting users with the new page, but this impact can be negative or positive compared to the current \"old design\". Therefore, I can use a two-tailed test with alpha threshold set to 0.05 with a confidence interval of 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_{0}$**: **$p_{old}$** = **$p_{new}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_{1}$**: **$p_{old}$** !=  **$p_{new}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the results have a p-value (probability of observing a change in the result) less than alpha = 0.05, then I will reject the null hypothesis. Rejecting the null hypothesis at alpha 0.05 means that I am 95% confident that the conversion rate observed in this test is statistically significant and different from the old design. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Metrics/Variables\n",
    "- Control group is shown the old page design\n",
    "- Treatment group is shown new page design\n",
    "- Conversion is a binary column where 1 represents user converted and 0 represents they didn't convert. This will be used to calculate conversion rate for both groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, my \"dependent variable\" will be conversion since it's the primary metric of focus. My \"independent variable\" will be the group since this contains our specified two groups where a change occurred, and I should see a resulting change in the dependent variable if there was an effect between new page and old page. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining Sample Size\n",
    "The control group and treatment groups are considered samples, which will help derive an estimate of the conversion rate for the true populuation. Therefore, I need to determine the right sample size for each group in order to detect a change or effect if there is one during the experiment. Three parameters are needed to determine sample size: \n",
    "- Power of the test (1 - Beta) or Type 2 error: Beta is usually set at 0.2, so power of test is usually set at 0.8. Power is the probability of finding a statistically significant result when the Null Hypothesis is false. Therefore, there's 80% chance for us to detect a statisically significant results with determined sample size. \n",
    "- Significance level or alpha: This has been established as 0.05. \n",
    "- Minimum detectable effect or effect size: This is the magnitude of the difference in conversion rate expected between the two groups. Business will usually define this. On average, conversion rate is 12%, but a 3% increase in conversion rate will be a meaningful change for the new page design to be successful. "
